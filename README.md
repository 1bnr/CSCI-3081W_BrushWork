# Project-Iterations

## Running the linter

It is assumed that prior to handing in any iteration of the project, you will
run the following command on all source files in your repository:

    python ext/cpplint/cpplint.py --linelength=81 <source files>

And that this command will report 0 errors found. You will be evaluated on an
all-or-nothing basis for this part of the project, so take care to do this.
