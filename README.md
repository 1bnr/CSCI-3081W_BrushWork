# Project-Iterations

## Running the linter

It is assumed that prior to handing in any iteration of the project, you will
run the following command on all source files in your repository:

    python ext/cpplint/cpplint.py --linelength=81 <source files>

And that this command will report 0 errors found. You will be evaluated on an
all-or-nothing basis for this part of the project, so take care to do this.

## git commit messages

- There should only ever be ONE scope/module affected per commit message.
- If you have an 'and' in a commit subject, consider breaking it into 2 commits.

These are examples of the quality of the commit messages we will be expecting.

* feat(onUrlChange): Added new event to $browser
  - forward popstate event if available
  - forward hashchange event if popstate not available
  - do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available
  Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)

* docs(project): Updated fixed docs from Google Docs
  Couple of typos fixed:
  - indentation
  - batchLogbatchLog -> batchLog
  - start periodic checking
  - missing brace
