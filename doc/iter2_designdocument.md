#### Instructions 
> Respond to each of the design questions below.  Make your answers factual and compelling.  Where appropriate, reference alternative designs you considered, code snippets, and diagrams within your writing in order to be clear and back up your claims.  As we have discussed in class, when writing with reference to figures make sure to tell the reader what to look for in the diagram or what exactly you want the reader to notice in the code snippet.  Remember that the design of your project is worth 1/3 of the total project grade.  Also remember that when grading the design portion of the project, this design justification document is the only thing we will look at.  This document must stand on its own.  Rather than linking to your actual code, carefully pick the most important code snippets from your project to include here in order to provide convincing detail for your answers to the questions below.  
> A few tips to maximize the success of your design document:  
>   1. Make sure the **description** of your design decision only contains an objective description of how you structured your design and how it was implemented (specifically how your solution solves the problem given in the prompt). Save any arguments in favor of your design for the **justification** section.  
>   2. Your justification will probably need to compare against at least one alternative, and you will need to provide a compelling argument for why your solution is better than the alternative.
>   3. Edit this file when writing your design document. Do not move or rename this file. Do not direct to any outside resources for your images or code. Place all images and code in this document. Please match the formatting of the [Example Design Document](https://github.umn.edu/umn-csci-3081F16/Example-Design-Document/blob/master/doc/DesignDocument.md) and [its source](https://raw.github.umn.edu/umn-csci-3081F16/Example-Design-Document/master/doc/DesignDocument.md?token=AAADyd5L8wd57F_qLX4Nf-2nVvfRlMj5ks5YH-qHwA%3D%3D) as precisely as possible, especially in regards to:
>     - **Formatting code** (do not include images of your code, make sure that your code is formatted with C++ coloring)
>     - **Inserting images**
>     - **Numbered lists for your tutorial**
>     - **Captioning your Figures**
>     - **Including the original prompts in their original quote form**  
> 
>  This formatting helps us grade your assignments effectively, and thus failure to meet these requirements may result in point deductions. Any material that is not presented in this design document will not be graded.




## 1  Design Question One
> This iteration of the project is all about tools. Naturally, a key design decision is how these tools are represented. Each tool has several characteristics, including the shape of the tool, its size, and the way it blends with the canvas when the tool is applied. Some tools share characteristics with other tools, such as how the pen and calligraphy pen tools blend with the canvas in the same manner. 
> First, in the **Design Description** section below, describe the design you developed to address this challenge. We expect that you will include at least one figure showing the relationships of the classes affected by your design. Second, in the **Design Justification** section below present the most compelling argument you can for why this design is justified.  Note that our expectation is that you will need to discuss the pros (and maybe cons) of your final design as compared to alternative designs that you discussed in your group in order to make a strong case for justifying your design.

## 2  Design Question Two
> Unlike most of the tools, the Eraser returns the canvas to its original color. One of the challenges in this iteration is giving the eraser the authority or information required to have this effect while having minimal impact on the way the rest of the tools are defined. 
> First, in the **Design Description** section below, describe the design you developed to address this challenge.  Second, in the **Design Justification** section below present the most compelling argument you can for why this design is justified.  Note that our expectation is that you will need to discuss the pros (and maybe cons) of your final design as compared to alternative designs that you discussed in your group in order to make a strong case for justifying your design.

## 3  Design Question Three
> A new developer on your team must add a new tool to BrushWork. This tool is called  _Pencil._ This tool is a single, non-transparent pixel that completely replaces the existing colors on the canvas in the same way as the pen or calligraphy pen blend.  
> Describe in the form of a tutorial (including code snippets) exactly what changes would need to be made to your program in order to fully integrate this new tool.
